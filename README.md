#  🔎 SVM Classification

## 🎯 Objective  
Use Support Vector Machines to classify breast cancer data using linear and RBF kernels.

## ✅ Tasks Performed  
- 📥 Loaded and scaled dataset  
- 🧠 Trained SVM with linear and RBF kernels  
- 📊 Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- 🔍 Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV  
- 🌐 Visualized decision regions using PCA

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📈 Output  
- Accuracy scores for both kernels  
- Best model parameters  
- Visualizations of support vectors and metrics
